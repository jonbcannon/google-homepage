At the start:

Took some work to remember how to use git and navigate to different directories. Also, had to remember how to set up a repo(sitory) on github, but I think I'm ready to start coding this thing.

Goal:

Going to try to recreate the Google homepage. Yikes.

Well, I kind of did it. That was pretty challenging. Learning that you pretty much have to style every single element it seems and be SUPER organized.
